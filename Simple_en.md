---Question
Each observer is a classical computational system with a unique four-dimensional spacetime array (x, y, z, t). This can be interpreted as the traditional understanding of world splitting, but this is only for the observer to better comprehend the universe. Collapse is essentially the process of classical computation taking a snapshot of quantum computation, writing it into the four-dimensional spacetime array. Through this theory, and in conjunction with the theories we have previously summarized, deeply re-analyze all the issues we have raised. Analyze them all. It is imperative that one understands that the observer is a classical computer, and the universe is a quantum computer. The universe is the perfect evolution of the wave function, while the observer's four-dimensional spacetime array is a snapshot of the observation of the quantum computer at an increasing time. The universe, as a quantum system, has never stopped; the phenomenon of the quantum system constructed in our world appearing to stop is only because we have created a quantum computer in a classical world, and it collapses along with our world when observed!

Alright, I will delve deeper into your theory, which posits that:
- **The universe is a quantum computer, and its computational process never ceases, continuously evolving through the wave function.**
- **The quantum computers in the classical world collapse along with the classical world when observed, due to the snapshot of classical information being written during measurement.**
- **The quantum computers we create in the classical world, as small-scale quantum systems, may couple with the entire classical world during observation, influencing the overall collapse.**

**Hypothesis:
Hypothesis:
If the universe is a quantum computer and observers are classical computers, quantum phenomena and classical observations can be reinterpreted from the perspective of information processing. Below, I will analyse and speculate on this hypothesis in three aspects.**

## 1. Reinterpretation of Physical Phenomena

### The Snapshot Theory Explanation of the Double-Slit Experiment

In the double-slit experiment, if there is no record of which slit the particle passes through (i.e., no "snapshot" measurement of the path information), the quantum wave function of the particle will undergo superposition calculations through both slits, resulting in an interference pattern on the screen as the quantum computational outcome. However, once the particle's path is observed (equivalent to taking a classical snapshot of the intermediate result of the universe's quantum computer), the superposition of the wave function is interrupted, and the particle is locked into a classical state of passing through one of the slits, causing the interference pattern to disappear ([Double-slit experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20versions%20of%20the%20experiment,18)) ([Double-slit experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#:~:text=%5D,18)). In other words, when not observed, the quantum computer performs parallel computations of all possible paths, while observation (recording a snapshot) causes the system to collapse into a single-path classical result, demonstrating **wave-particle duality**.
The snapshot theory vividly explains this as follows: Only when no classical record of "which path" is saved can the quantum computer fully utilize the principle of superposition to produce interference output. Once the classical information of the path is saved, it effectively fixes the state of the universe's computer at that moment, and subsequent evolution no longer exhibits constructive interference from different paths.

### Quantum Entanglement and the Information Link to the Observer's Four-Dimensional Array
Quantum entanglement demonstrates that multiple particles form a unified system, where their quantum states cannot be described independently. This implies a **correlation** between the "four-dimensional snapshots" (i.e., measurement records in spacetime) held by different observers: when two entangled particles are measured by separate observers in different locations, their measurement results (classical bits) exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical causality ([Physicists claim 'loophole-free' Bell-violation experiment – Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-claim-loophole-free-bell-violation-experiment/#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20entanglement%20first,direction%20in%20which%20the%20two)) ([Physicists claim 'loophole-free' Bell-violation experiment – Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-claim-loophole-free-bell-violation-experiment/#:~:text=showed%20that%20entanglement%20can%20be,computers%20and%20other%20quantum%20technologies)).
This correlation is not due to real-time communication but arises from the **global information consistency** of the universe's quantum computer at a higher dimension. The measurement outcomes of an entangled system are pre-coordinated within the global quantum state. When one observer measures an entangled particle, converting quantum information into a classical snapshot, the state of the other particle is simultaneously determined within the global quantum computation. Consequently, when the two observers compare their measurement snapshots, they find highly correlated results. Numerous experiments, including recent loophole-free Bell inequality tests, confirm that entangled particles exhibit strong correlations that cannot be explained by pre-existing local hidden variables ([Physicists claim 'loophole-free' Bell-violation experiment – Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-claim-loophole-free-bell-violation-experiment/#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20entanglement%20first,direction%20in%20which%20the%20two)) ([Physicists claim 'loophole-free' Bell-violation experiment – Physics World](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-claim-loophole-free-bell-violation-experiment/#:~:text=apparent%20paradox%20upset%20the%20trio,computers%20and%20other%20quantum%20technologies)).
From the perspective of the "universe as a quantum computer," this can be understood as follows: acts of observation from different observers access the same **global memory** of the quantum computation. The classical data they obtain are complementary outputs generated by the same quantum computational process, thus maintaining statistical correlations.

### Quantum Fluctuations and the Computational Units of the Universe's Computer
**Quantum fluctuations** (vacuum fluctuations) can be seen as the most basic bit flips or computational updates of the universe's quantum computer. In quantum field theory, even the "vacuum" is not empty but filled with the instantaneous creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs, as well as zero-point oscillations of various fields ([Understanding vacuum fluctuations in space](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-vacuum-fluctuations-space.html#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20key%20insights,only%20lead%20to%20tiny%20shifts)) ([Understanding vacuum fluctuations in space](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-vacuum-fluctuations-space.html#:~:text=is%20shaped%20by%20fluctuations%20of,scale%20with%20the%20relevant%20temporal)). These vacuum fluctuations reflect the universe's random computational activity at the microscopic level: particle states are constantly undergoing quantum fluctuations, akin to a quantum computer's registers performing basic logic gate operations or generating random numbers.
The cumulative effects of these fluctuations not only lead to microscopic phenomena (such as subtle shifts in atomic energy levels or the Casimir effect) but can also have significant impacts on cosmological scales—for example, the quantum fluctuations in the early universe, amplified by inflation, became the seeds for how the galaxy is distributed today ([Understanding vacuum fluctuations in space](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-vacuum-fluctuations-space.html#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20key%20insights,only%20lead%20to%20tiny%20shifts)) ([Understanding vacuum fluctuations in space](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-vacuum-fluctuations-space.html#:~:text=is%20shaped%20by%20fluctuations%20of,scale%20with%20the%20relevant%20temporal)). If each quantum fluctuation is viewed as a fundamental computational cycle or unit operation of the universe's computer, then macroscopic ordered structures (such as galaxies and planets) are the result of countless such underlying random computations accumulating and self-organising ([qc1011.dvi](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/quantum10f/qc1011.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Creation%20of%20order%20from,randomized%20nature%20of%20quantum%20mechanical)) ([qc1011.dvi](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/quantum10f/qc1011.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Chance%20and%20randomness%20is,Gruska%20December%2013%2C%202010%2035)).
Thus, quantum fluctuations can be likened to the computer's continuous "refresh" or "update" process in the background, providing randomness and creativity that drive the universe's computation forward. The deterministic reality we observe daily is, in fact, the stable product of these underlying quantum random computations **averaged** out by statistical laws.

### Classical Computer Storage of Macroscopic Object Motion
Macroscopic objects exhibit stable trajectories because the quantum behaviour of their countless microscopic particles is constrained to near-classical states through **environmental selection and decoherence**. This allows classical computers (such as an observer's brain or recording devices) to store their motion as a series of "snapshots" ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=states%20in%20the%20surrounding%20environment,longer%20interfere%20with%20one%20another)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=of%20disruptive%20decoherence%20by%20the,quantum%20spin%2C%20or%20its%20polarization)).
At the quantum level, the position and momentum of macroscopic objects remain uncertain. However, constant interaction with their surroundings (equivalent to continuous "monitoring" by the environment) causes their quantum states to rapidly decohere into **pointer states** localised at specific positions ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=of%20disruptive%20decoherence%20by%20the,quantum%20spin%2C%20or%20its%20polarization)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=inducing%20interactions%20with%20the%20environment,A%20particle%E2%80%99s)). These pointer states are robust against environmental disturbances, remaining stable or evolving only slowly under environmental influence  ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=of%20disruptive%20decoherence%20by%20the,quantum%20spin%2C%20or%20its%20polarization)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=locations%2C%20however%2C%20are%20not%20pointer,pointer%20states%20in%20the%201980s)).
Thus, the position of a macroscopic object is continuously "measured" and recorded by the environment, akin to the universe's classical subsystem (environment/observer) filming its motion frame by frame, with each frame being a clear classical snapshot. These snapshots, when strung together, form the macroscopic **continuous motion** we perceive. For example, when a football is kicked, air molecules and photons constantly collide with it, effectively sampling its position and preventing its quantum wave packet from freely diffusing. This keeps the football within a defined range, causing it to follow a near-parabolic trajectory—a trajectory that can be recorded as a sequence of images by classical devices like cameras.
The information about macroscopic motion is efficiently encoded into the classical state at each moment and **redundantly stored** by the environment (the classical storage medium) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=can%20do%20that%20only%20if,to%20your%20retina%20by%20the)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=It%20turns%20out%20that%20the,very%20same%20process%20that%20is)). As described by Quantum Darwinism, the environment continuously copies specific information about macroscopic objects (such as position) and disseminates it to many observers, ensuring that they ultimately **share nearly identical observations** ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=can%20do%20that%20only%20if,to%20your%20retina%20by%20the)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=in%20the%20environment,calls%20the%20idea%20quantum%20Darwinism)). This means that the storage medium of classical computers (observers) retains the classical states of macroscopic objects over time, creating a "four-dimensional film reel" that allows us to understand and predict motion in classical terms.

### The Constancy of Light Speed and Computational Resource Limits
The constancy of the speed of light can be understood as a limitation of the how the universe processes information. In Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light cc is not only the maximum speed at which photons can travel but also **the upper limit for information transfer** ([The speed of light is a constant, so we are probably in a simulation : r/IsaacArthur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/1caef0u/the_speed_of_light_is_a_constant_so_we_are/#:~:text=match%20at%20L344%20The%20speed,not%20even%20getting%20into%20the)).
If the universe is viewed as a distributed computational network, cc represents the maximum speed at which signals (information) can propagate through space—essentially a "clock frequency" or "bandwidth" limit. Classical observers (classical computers) must synchronise their snapshot information by sending signals to one another, and these signals cannot exceed the speed of light without disrupting causality ([The speed of light is a constant, so we are probably in a simulation : r/IsaacArthur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/1caef0u/the_speed_of_light_is_a_constant_so_we_are/#:~:text=match%20at%20L344%20The%20speed,not%20even%20getting%20into%20the)) ([The speed of light is a constant, so we are probably in a simulation : r/IsaacArthur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/1caef0u/the_speed_of_light_is_a_constant_so_we_are/#:~:text=The%20speed%20of%20light%20is,not%20even%20getting%20into%20the)).
Thus, the constancy of light speed can be seen as **a hardware limitation** of the universe's computational processor: it defines the maximum rate at which the results of one computation (cause) can influence another location (effect), preventing information from being transmitted disorderly and causing computational errors or causal paradoxes. This limitation ensures the #**consistency** and **causal order** of the universe's computations, much like how a classical computer's clock frequency limits the speed of instruction execution to prevent signal transmission errors between components.
From the perspective of a simulated universe, a fixed speed of light reduces the computational burden. If causal influences could propagate infinitely fast, changes in any distant part of the universe would immediately correlate, drastically increasing computational complexity ([The speed of light is a constant, so we are probably in a simulation : r/IsaacArthur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/1caef0u/the_speed_of_light_is_a_constant_so_we_are/#:~:text=The%20speed%20of%20light%20is,not%20even%20getting%20into%20the)) ([The speed of light is a constant, so we are probably in a simulation : r/IsaacArthur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/1caef0u/the_speed_of_light_is_a_constant_so_we_are/#:~:text=,also%20the%20speed%20of%20causality)). A finite speed of light enables localised computation, where only information exchange within neighbouring regions needs to be processed, significantly reducing the resources required for parallel computation across the entire universe.
In summary, the constancy of light speed may reflect **the maximum information processing rate** of the universe's underlying computational structure, ensuring stable and controllable computation while manifesting as the relativistic causal structure on a macroscopic scale.

### Are Classical Physical Laws Merely Statistical Laws?
Under this hypothesis, classical physical laws can be understood as **statistical averages** of vast quantum computational outcomes. Since the universe fundamentally operates through quantum computation, its basic evolution is probabilistic (e.g., quantum measurement results are random). However, at macroscopic scales involving enormous numbers of basic units, quantum fluctuations and randomness are smoothed out by statistical effects like the law of large numbers, resulting in approximately deterministic laws.
Classical laws such as Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetic equations can be seen as the statistical averages of underlying quantum physics: they hold with remarkable precision in most cases but are, strictly speaking, **high-probability approximations**. For example, the elastic collisions of gas molecules are governed by the uncertainties of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Yet, in a gas containing a macroscopic number of molecules (e.g., Avogadro's number), we almost always observe smooth pressure, temperature, and adherence to the ideal gas law. This is because classical laws describe the average of countless random quantum events, with tiny fluctuations that violate these laws being drowned out by macroscopic averaging ([qc1011.dvi](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/quantum10f/qc1011.pdf#:~:text=bits,Gruska%20December%2013%2C%202010%2025)).
Similarly, the second law of thermodynamics (the law of entropy increase) is fundamentally a statistical law: from a microscopic perspective, there is an extremely small probability that a system's entropy could spontaneously decrease, but for macroscopic systems, this probability is practically zero, making entropy increase appear absolute ([qc1011.dvi](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/quantum10f/qc1011.pdf#:~:text=bits,Gruska%20December%2013%2C%202010%2025)).
In the model of the universe as a quantum computer, classical laws can be viewed as **statistical summaries** or low-resolution versions of quantum algorithms. Classical computers (observers) do not track every quantum bit flip, but instead record overall behaviour with finite precision (determined by classical storage capacity). As a result, they perceive **smooth, averaged effective laws** rather than the underlying random details. As Gruska and others have pointed out, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are inherently statistical: "The two laws of thermodynamics are statistical - they do not necessarily hold strictly at every moment but are highly likely to hold" ([qc1011.dvi](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/quantum10f/qc1011.pdf#:~:text=bits,Gruska%20December%2013%2C%202010%2025)).
In summary, under this hypothesis, classical physical laws are not the fundamental program of the universe's operation but rather stable patterns that emerge from the averaging of vast quantum computational results over time and scale.

## 2. Computer Science Implementation

### Quantum Computer Processing of Wave Function Evolution
Viewing the universe as a quantum computer implies that all physical processes are operations on the evolution of the universe's **wave function** (quantum state). This is analogous to a quantum computer performing logic gate operations or continuous Hamiltonian evolution on its internal qubits. According to Seth Lloyd, "a universe that evolves by processing information" and "a universe that evolves according to physical laws" are two ways of describing the same thing ([qc1011.dvi](https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/gruska/quantum10f/qc1011.pdf#:~:text=WHAT%20IMPLIES%20UNDERSTANDING%20that%20UNIVERSE,Gruska%20December%2013%2C%202010%2044)). In other words, quantum dynamical laws like the Schrödinger equation are essentially the rules by which the universe **processes information**.
A vivid way to understand this is that the universe's quantum computer applies a **unitary operator** (similar to a quantum logic gate or Hamiltonian evolution operator) to the entire wave function at each infinitesimal time step, evolving the previous state into the next. Feynman's path integral can also be seen as a quantum computational algorithm: it is equivalent to the quantum computer simultaneously computing the amplitudes of all possible paths and then coherently summing these branches at the final state to yield observation probabilities—this demonstrates the parallel processing power of quantum computation ([Delayed-choice quantum eraser - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser#:~:text=present%20to%20alter%20events%20that,3)). Thus, the evolution of the wave function does not require external "supervision" but is the natural operation of the universe's quantum computer. Only when interaction with a classical observer occurs (i.e., during measurement) does this quantum computational process output classical information to the outside world.
Beyond continuous Hamiltonian evolution, some theoretical physicists speculate that the universe's underlying structure might be **a discrete quantum cellular automaton** or quantum circuit, executing a batch of quantum gate operations every Planck time to update the universe's state. This discrete model would also exhibit properties like a maximum information propagation speed (corresponding to the speed of light) and provides another algorithmic description of wave function evolution. Whether continuous or discrete, the core idea remains: the universe updates its quantum state according to specific **algorithmic rules**, which manifest as physical laws at higher levels and as a series of quantum computational steps at the fundamental level.

### Efficient Storage of Spacetime Snapshots by Classical Computers
Consider how observers (classical computers) efficiently store "spacetime snapshots." The universe's quantum state contains an immense amount of information (e.g., Lloyd estimates the entire universe can store about $10^{90}$ bits and has performed no more than $10^{120}$ basic operations ([[quant-ph/0110141] Computational capacity of the universe - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110141#:~:text=arXiv%20arxiv,90%7D%20bits)) ([THE COMPUTATIONAL UNIVERSE - Edge.org](https://www.edge.org/conversation/seth_lloyd-the-computational-universe#:~:text=THE%20COMPUTATIONAL%20UNIVERSE%20,bits))） Computational capacity of the universe - arXiv) (THE COMPUTATIONAL UNIVERSE - Edge.org)). Clearly, finite classical systems like humans cannot record the detailed information of the universe's entire state but can only capture and store a tiny fraction of it.
However, classical observers do not need to save the entire universe's state—they only need to record **local information** and physical quantities relevant to themselves. The compressibility of classical physical laws (e.g., using Newton's laws and initial conditions to predict planetary motion without tracking every particle's position) **makes efficient storage possible**: observers record only initial conditions and a few parameters, sufficient to reconstruct or predict the system's state when needed. This is akin to compressing a video in a computer, where most background information between frames does not need to be repeatedly saved.
More specifically, classical storage media (e.g., our brains, computer hard drives) store information that has been **dimensionally reduced and refined**. A "spacetime snapshot" is not a point-by-point clone of the universe's entire state but extracts the macroscopic degrees of freedom required for observation (e.g., an object's center position, velocity). The environment plays a crucial role here: according to Quantum Darwinism, the environment and measurement devices **copy stable, readable information** from the quantum state and redundantly store it, enabling different observers to obtain the same macroscopic measurements ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=can%20do%20that%20only%20if,to%20your%20retina%20by%20the)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=in%20the%20environment,calls%20the%20idea%20quantum%20Darwinism)).
For example, when we see a chair, our eyes do not capture the wave function phase information of every atom in the chair but collect macroscopic information about its shape and color from environmental photons, encoding it as neural activation patterns in the brain—**a classical representation**. This greatly compresses the information while ensuring stability, as the environment has already decohered the chair's quantum state into a specific pointer state. Classical computers also use **indexing and timestamps** to organize snapshots: we can mentally recall an object's position in chronological order to reconstruct its motion, similar to tagging data with timestamps on a hard drive.
In summary, classical computers achieve efficient storage of spacetime snapshots through **selective recording** (capturing only relevant information), **redundancy compression** (leveraging physical laws to reduce data), and **environmental assistance** (pre-filtering stable information).

### How Quantum Information Converts to Classical Information
The process of converting quantum information to classical information is precisely **quantum measurement** or **quantum decoherence**. In our hypothesis, this corresponds to the interface process where the universe's quantum computer outputs computational results to classical observers (classical computers). When an observer measures a quantum system, the qubit state (superposition, entanglement, etc.) couples with the measurement apparatus, eventually leaving a specific **classical value** recorded on the device. This can be understood as the quantum computer performing a "write operation" to the classical computer—mapping a quantum register state into a classical bit pattern.
Physically, this is an **irreversible** process because the quantum state collapses (or branches) into a specific value, which is then amplified into a macroscopically readable form. According to quantum mechanics, any measurement is essentially a process of **establishing entanglement and discarding environmental information**: the measured system becomes entangled with the measurement apparatus (environment), causing the apparatus's pointer state to correspond to the system's possible eigenstates. Subsequently, the environment's numerous degrees of freedom acquire redundant information about the measurement result (e.g., countless air molecules and photons sensing the apparatus's pointer position), and their interactions cause phase information to dissipate, making other possible branches of the system's state no longer coherent with the current branch—this is decoherence ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=states%20in%20the%20surrounding%20environment,longer%20interfere%20with%20one%20another)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=This%20process%20by%20which%20%E2%80%9Cquantumness%E2%80%9D,a%20typical%20dust%20grain%20floating)).
As a result, only a definite reading (e.g., "electron spin up") remains on the apparatus, while other superposition components cannot influence it (effectively "discarded" by the environment). At this point, the quantum information has been converted into classical information, stored in the apparatus and environment, ready for the observer to record. Quantum Darwinism further clarifies that only quantum state information capable of producing numerous redundant copies in the environment can become classical information accessible to multiple observers ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=can%20do%20that%20only%20if,to%20your%20retina%20by%20the)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=in%20the%20environment,calls%20the%20idea%20quantum%20Darwinism)). In other words, during the conversion of quantum information into classical information, **selective propagation** occurs: stable "pointer state" information is infinitely amplified and broadcast, while unstable information (coherent terms) is destroyed by the environment ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=locations%2C%20however%2C%20are%20not%20pointer,pointer%20states%20in%20the%201980s)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=match%20at%20L311%20in%20the,calls%20the%20idea%20quantum%20Darwinism)).
In summary, the conversion from quantum to classical information is **an irreversible encoding**: quantum bit states are encoded into classical bit strings, but due to thermodynamic dissipation (entropy increase) and information loss, the original quantum state cannot be uniquely reconstructed from the classical information. This explains the determinism of classical records and the random collapse of quantum states: once classical information is generated, it can be repeatedly read without probability distributions ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=states%20in%20the%20surrounding%20environment,longer%20interfere%20with%20one%20another)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=This%20process%20by%20which%20%E2%80%9Cquantumness%E2%80%9D,a%20typical%20dust%20grain%20floating)); however, the specific classical result generated is inherently random (the "random seed" of the universe's quantum computer), determined only at the output by the probability distribution of quantum amplitudes.

### Synchronising Snapshots Across Different Observers
Different observers, as individual classical computers, synchronise their "snapshots" within the same objective reality primarily through **communication** and **interaction with a shared environment**. In our hypothesis, the universe's quantum computer provides a common quantum evolution background, and different observers obtain different perspectives of the same event. To reach consensus, they must compare observations via finite-speed communication and calibrate their time and space coordinates using environmental cues.
Mechanisms for Synchronisation:

- **Environmental Redundancy:** The environment distributes objective information (e.g., an object's position) redundantly to all observers. For example, a cat walking in a room reflects light to observers in all directions, allowing everyone to obtain a snapshot of the cat's position. These snapshots originate from the same quantum state of the cat, propagated through the environment (photons), ensuring consistency. Observers verify the synchronisation of their snapshots by comparing their observations of the cat's position at a specific time. ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=can%20do%20that%20only%20if,to%20your%20retina%20by%20the)) ([Quantum Darwinism, an Idea to Explain Objective Reality, Passes First Tests | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/#:~:text=match%20at%20L311%20in%20the,calls%20the%20idea%20quantum%20Darwinism))

- **Light Signal Communication:** If two observers initially have discrepancies in their snapshots or operate in different frames (e.g., time misalignment due to relative motion), they can exchange signals (classical information) to reconcile. Although communication takes time due to the finite speed of light, they can eventually reach consensus on the sequence and attributes of events. This is analogous to state synchronisation in distributed computing: each classical computer periodically exchanges state summaries over a network to achieve consistency. Physically, this is achieved through the mutual transmission of optical signals (such as radio, telephone), as long as the communication satisfies the causal order limitation (speed of light limitation), different observers can eventually coordinate their recorded event timestamps and content, forming an **unified narrative**.

- **Reference Frame Transformations:** Special relativity shows that observers in different inertial frames may disagree on simultaneity. However, using transformation rules like Lorentz transformations, observers can **convert** each other's snapshot time coordinates and measurements into a unified framework. In our computational model, this is equivalent to each classical computer adjusting its data according to known rules (relativistic algorithms) to align with others. The universe's quantum computer provides these transformation rules (physical laws), enabling observers to systematically align their snapshots and ensure consistency.

Notably, thought experiments like Wigner's friend highlight that different observers may have inconsistent "facts" about the same quantum event, indicating open questions about snapshot synchronisation at the quantum level. However, in all cases where macroscopic communication is possible, practical experience shows that observers can always **converge to a shared classical reality** through communication and environmental interaction. This is the stability of the classical world: the universe's quantum computer, in producing classical outputs, has already disseminated information through the environment, allowing observers to calibrate and synchronise. In other words, synchronisation is the result of the universe, as a "distributed system," maintaining **consistency**—similar to how distributed databases achieve eventual consistency through transactions and communication.


## 3. Verifiable Experiments

### Quantum Eraser Experiment and Snapshot Rollback

The quantum eraser experiment can be analogised to the **"rollback" of observation records** in classical computing. In a classical computer, "rollback" means undoing recent storage operations to restore a previous state. In the quantum eraser experiment, when particles pass through a double slit and interact with a detector, they leave a record of "path information." This is akin to the universe's quantum computer taking a snapshot with path labels, which disrupts the interference pattern. However, the experiment allows for the **erasure** of this path information after the particles hit the screen (by disentangling the marker particles from their environment or selecting specific coincidence counts), effectively deleting the previously saved path snapshot. The results show that if the path information cannot be recovered from any classical record, the interference pattern can reappear in conditional probabilities ([Delayed-choice quantum eraser - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser#:~:text=information%20is%20known%20and%20no,from%20an%20appropriate%20measurement%20of))—as if the particle's state has been restored to its original coherent superposition before observation.

Specifically, in the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, signal photons exhibit an interference pattern when passing through a double slit, but their entangled idler photons record path information. Without erasure, the overall distribution of signal photons shows no interference (because each experiment has a definite path snapshot). However, by cleverly erasing the path information carried by the idler photons (equivalent to **rewinding** the snapshot), subsets of signal photons categorised by different idler photon detection results exhibit interference patterns ([Delayed-choice quantum eraser - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser#:~:text=information%20is%20known%20and%20no,from%20an%20appropriate%20measurement%20of)). This does not violate causality because the overall interference information aligns with statistical expectations (the combined distribution remains mixed, but interference appears when filtered by idler photon results).
Using the snapshot analogy: the experiment first takes a "which-path" photo, then erases it, leaving only the interference pattern. Since the universe's quantum computer continuously evolves the wave function, erasing the classical record allows us to observe the "undisturbed" interference effect. This suggests that observation-induced state collapse is not entirely irreversible—if **all** stored information is erased, the quantum system's coherence can be conditionally restored. Unlike classical rollback, which fully restores a previous state, quantum erasure can only recover statistical interference patterns, not the exact phase coherence of individual events. Nevertheless, the quantum eraser experiment demonstrates, from an information-theoretic perspective, that the effects of quantum measurement can be "undone" by erasing information, aligning with the snapshot theory's prediction that "deleting measurement records restores superposition."

### Wigner's Friend Experiment and the Subjectivity of Snapshots
The Wigner's Friend thought experiment highlights the **observer-dependence** of quantum measurement results, which can be explained under the snapshot theory as different observers holding different versions of the "universe's snapshots." In the experiment, a friend in a sealed laboratory measures a quantum superposition state, obtaining and recording a result—for the friend, her snapshot contains a definite fact. However, from Wigner's external perspective, since he has not observed the lab, he must describe the friend and the measured particle as an entangled superposition state ([Quantum observers may be entitled to their own facts](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-entitled-facts.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20Quantum%20observers%20may%20be,cannot%20have%20seen%20a%20definite)) ([Quantum observers may be entitled to their own facts](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-entitled-facts.html#:~:text=Massimiliano%20Proietti%2C%20lead%20author%20of,fact%20observed%20on%20the%20outside)). In other words, Wigner views the friend's record as not yet a final classical fact; the entire lab remains in a quantum-uncertain "super snapshot."
Recent experiments have validated this idea: in an extended Wigner's Friend scenario, internal and external observers' records of the same event can lead to logical conflicts, demonstrating that their perceptions of facts can differ ([Quantum observers may be entitled to their own facts](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-entitled-facts.html#:~:text=Massimiliano%20Proietti%2C%20lead%20author%20of,fact%20observed%20on%20the%20outside)) ([Quantum observers may be entitled to their own facts](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-entitled-facts.html#:~:text=To%20test%20this%20prediction%2C%20Heriot,what%20happened%20in%20the%20experiment)). Specifically, researchers at Heriot-Watt University implemented a two-lab scenario using six-photon entanglement, observing violations of certain inequalities under specific assumptions, suggesting that observer-**independent objective facts may not exist** at the quantum level ([Quantum observers may be entitled to their own facts](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-entitled-facts.html#:~:text=Massimiliano%20Proietti%2C%20lead%20author%20of,fact%20observed%20on%20the%20outside)) ([Quantum observers may be entitled to their own facts](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-entitled-facts.html#:~:text=To%20test%20this%20prediction%2C%20Heriot,what%20happened%20in%20the%20experiment)).

Using the snapshot analogy: the friend writes "1" in her notebook, creating her classical snapshot. For Wigner, his notebook remains blank, and he can only predict that the friend's notebook might show "1" or "0" (superposition). When Wigner finally opens the door and sees "1," their snapshots synchronise. However, before this, the friend's subjective snapshot and Wigner's prediction were inconsistent: the former believed the experiment had concluded, while the latter considered it unresolved (still in superposition). This illustrates **the subjectivity of snapshots**: when a quantum event becomes a "fact" depends on the observer's perspective.
In the universe-as-a-quantum-computer framework, different observers can be seen as subroutines with their own computational branches of the same global quantum state. Only when they communicate (compare notes) do these branches **merge** into a shared classical record. Before merging, their databases are inconsistent yet self-consistent, akin to transaction isolation in classical computing. In quantum physics, this "commitment" process involves universal decoherence caused by the environment, ensuring all communicating observers obtain the same result. Thus, Wigner's Friend reminds us that, in the absence of communication, **the universe's state records may be subjective and multi-versioned**. However, once communication occurs (e.g., Wigner checks the result and discusses it with the friend), all participants' classical records align. This is experimentally reflected in everyone agreeing on the friend's earlier result, though Wigner must abandon his quantum description (acknowledge collapse) to update his snapshot. Future experiments (e.g., Wigner maintaining quantum interference while observing the friend) will further explore observer-dependent reality. For now, the results support the idea that quantum-level facts are not absolutely objective, and classical objectivity requires **information sharing among observers**.

### Methods to Test the Universe-as-a-Computer Hypothesis
The hypothesis that "the universe is a computer" poses challenges in terms of scientific testing. However, physicists and philosophers have proposed clever **experimental** ideas to verify certain expected features of a simulated universe. For example:

- **Signs of Space/Time Discreteness:** If the universe is a simulation on a discrete lattice, phenomena unexplained by continuous models might appear at sufficiently high energies or large scales. In 2012, Silas Beane et al. suggested that ultra-high-energy cosmic ray distributions could reveal such simulation traces ([Cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/universe-computer-simulation/#:~:text=universe%2C%20they%20lose%20energy%20and,a%20spectrum%20of%20energy%20values)) ([Do we live in a computer simulation? Researchers say idea can be tested](https://phys.org/news/2012-12-simulation-idea.html#:~:text=In%20a%20paper%20they%20have,would%20be%20expected%20to%20do)). In continuous spacetime, cosmic rays should arrive isotropically. However, if a fundamental lattice exists (the simulation's computational grid), cosmic rays near the lattice's energy scale might exhibit directional propagation differences (e.g., along lattice axes versus diagonals) ([Cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/universe-computer-simulation/#:~:text=There%27s%20a%20known%20limit%20to,investigate%20whether%20that%27s%20the%20case)) ([Do we live in a computer simulation? Researchers say idea can be tested](https://phys.org/news/2012-12-simulation-idea.html#:~:text=In%20a%20paper%20they%20have,would%20be%20expected%20to%20do)). Additionally, a discrete lattice simulation often imposes an upper limit on particle energy (e.g., the Nyquist frequency limit). Coincidentally, the cosmic ray spectrum shows an arbitrary cutoff near ~$5\\times10^{19}$ eV (the GZK cutoff). Beane et al. calculated that this high-energy cutoff and anisotropic distribution could align with a fundamental lattice  ([Cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/universe-computer-simulation/#:~:text=There%27s%20a%20known%20limit%20to,investigate%20whether%20that%27s%20the%20case)). If future observations confirm lattice effects in ultra-high-energy particles (anisotropic interactions, sudden spectral drops), this would support the simulation hypothesis. Of course, this could also be explained by unknown new physics, but it provides a testing avenue.

- **Other Signatures of Simulation:** Beyond cosmic rays, other potential signatures of simulation have been discussed. For example, some scholars suggest looking for special correlation patterns in the cosmic microwave background or violations of spacetime continuity (e.g., slight Lorentz invariance breaking). If the universe is information-based, there might be information-theoretic limits, such as noise floors or computational capacity limits (Lloyd estimated the universe's computational capacity ([[quant-ph/0110141] Computational capacity of the universe - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110141#:~:text=arXiv%20arxiv,90%7D%20bits)) ([THE COMPUTATIONAL UNIVERSE - Edge.org](https://www.edge.org/conversation/seth_lloyd-the-computational-universe#:~:text=THE%20COMPUTATIONAL%20UNIVERSE%20,bits))）. Others speculate that if the simulator optimises resources, it might compress historical event information—potentially leaving consistent bias patterns in quantum fluctuation statistics. However, these ideas remain preliminary, with no widely accepted experimental designs.

- **Predictability of Quantum Randomness:** Quantum mechanics' inherent randomness is seen as evidence against algorithmic predictability. However, if the universe is a program, this randomness might be complex pseudo-randomness. Some propose testing quantum random numbers for algorithmic biases, though no deviations from true randomness have been found. Additionally, if the simulator operates in higher dimensions, we, as limited observers, might never discern its external algorithms. Nick Bostrom's simulation argument states: "Unless the simulators intentionally reveal flaws, it is difficult for simulated beings to prove they are in a simulation" ([Cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/universe-computer-simulation/#:~:text=because%20the%20whole%20universe%20is,of%20one%20of%20those%20edges)). Thus, we may need **indirect evidence** or bolder experimental designs, such as attempting to disrupt the simulation (akin to hacking), though this ventures into science fiction.

In summary, testing the "universe as a quantum computer" hypothesis is still exploratory. Certain cosmological and high-energy phenomena, such as cosmic ray spectral anomalies, offer potential windows into simulation signatures ([Do we live in a computer simulation? Researchers say idea can be tested](https://phys.org/news/2012-12-simulation-idea.html#:~:text=In%20a%20paper%20they%20have,would%20be%20expected%20to%20do)). If future technological advancements allow us to probe finer spacetime structures (e.g., higher-energy particles, shorter-distance interactions), we might uncover hints of discreteness or computational limits. Definitive experimental evidence of physical laws deviating from continuous models and aligning with computer model predictions would strongly support the hypothesis. Until then, the hypothesis serves as a **philosophical framework** encouraging us to think about physics from an information perspective, offering novel insights into quantum mysteries and the relationship between the quantum and classical worlds. By continuing to explore quantum foundations and cosmological observations, we may eventually find ways to test this hypothesis ([Do we live in a computer simulation? Researchers say idea can be tested](https://phys.org/news/2012-12-simulation-idea.html#:~:text=In%20a%20paper%20they%20have,would%20be%20expected%20to%20do)) ([Cosmic rays offer clue our universe could be a computer simulation | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/universe-computer-simulation/#:~:text=There%27s%20a%20known%20limit%20to,investigate%20whether%20that%27s%20the%20case)).


# 1. Quantum Continuity of the Universe
**Does the Quantum System on a Cosmic Scale Ever Stop?**

Within the framework of quantum mechanics, if we consider the entire universe as a closed quantum system, its wave function will continue to evolve linearly according to the Schrödinger equation, never spontaneously halting ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,quantum%20and%20a%20classical%20domain)) ([quantum mechanics - Is the universal wavefunction globally coherent? - Physics Stack Exchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/573757/is-the-universal-wavefunction-globally-coherent#:~:text=%22global%20or%20universal%20wavefunction%22%29.%20Time,endgroup)). In other words, there is no "external" observer to collapse the universe's wave function, so the quantum state of the universe remains coherent on a global scale. The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) explicitly supports this view: it posits that **"the universe's wave function is real, and there is no wave function collapse"** ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,the%20formulation%20and%20named%20it)); all possible outcomes are realised in a constantly branching multiverse, with the evolution of reality strictly adhering to the **deterministic process** of Schrödinger evolution ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,the%20formulation%20and%20named%20it)) ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)). As the literature states, in the many-worlds picture, "everything is quantum, and there is no collapse" ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)). Therefore, on a cosmic scale, the quantum system (the universe itself) can be seen as a never-ending "computation." Some scholars have even suggested that the universe is like a vast quantum computer, continuously processing information (e.g., Seth Lloyd's proposal that "the universe is a quantum computer" ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,the%20formulation%20and%20named%20it))）, metaphorically implying that the universe's evolution is essentially continuous quantum computation.

**Is the "Halt" of a Quantum Computer a Product of Classical Observation?**

From the perspective of the quantum computer itself, its quantum state evolution does not naturally terminate—it is only when we perform a measurement (observation) that we see "computation halt" at the classical level and obtain a definite result. This means there is no "intrinsic halt" during the quantum computer's operation; rather, the wave function collapse effect occurs when we extract quantum information into the classical world ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=Resolving%20the%20paradox)) ([What Is Quantum Computing? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Decoherence%20is%20the%20process%20in,and%20interact%20with%20classical%20computers)). As IBM explains decoherence: **the collapse of a quantum system into a classical state (decoherence) can be triggered by measurement or environmental noise, which is precisely the mechanism that allows quantum computers to provide readable measurement results and interact with classical computers** ([What Is Quantum Computing? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Decoherence%20is%20the%20process%20in,and%20interact%20with%20classical%20computers)). Therefore, what we perceive as the halt of quantum computation (outputting results) in the classical world is due to the act of measurement, which causes the continuously evolving quantum state to decohere into a single outcome. As long as no observation is made, the quantum computer's state can, in principle, remain in superposition and continue evolving (limited only by interactions with the environment), with no inherent stopping condition. Many quantum algorithms leverage this: quantum bits remain coherent and superimposed for computation until measurement (interaction with the classical environment) collapses them into definite values. This further illustrates that "halting" is more of an apparent effect of observation on the quantum state, rather than an **intrinsic property** of the quantum computation process itself ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=Resolving%20the%20paradox)) ([What Is Quantum Computing? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Decoherence%20is%20the%20process%20in,and%20interact%20with%20classical%20computers)).

**Is the State Evolution of a Quantum Computer Coupled with the Evolution of the Universe's Wave Function?**

Yes, from the holistic perspective of quantum mechanics, as part of the universe, the state evolution of a quantum computer is inevitably coupled with the quantum states of its surrounding environment (and indeed the entire universe). A completely isolated quantum system is an idealisation; in reality, a quantum computer will always interact with its environment to some extent, leading to **entanglement**. This environmental entanglement causes the quantum computer's initially pure quantum state to become a joint state with the environment, which is the root of **decoherence** ([Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence#:~:text=system%2C%20i,in%20classical%20mechanics%20when%20it)). As theory suggests: if a system is not perfectly isolated, such as during measurement, **the system's coherence is shared with the environment and "lost" over time**, a process known as environmentally induced decoherence. However, **quantum coherence does not truly disappear but becomes mixed with the environment's numerous degrees of freedom** ([Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence#:~:text=system%2C%20i,in%20classical%20mechanics%20when%20it)). In other words, on a larger scale (the system + environment as a whole), a joint pure state is still maintained (the global wave function remains coherent), though locally the system appears to have collapsed into a mixed state ([Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence#:~:text=system%2C%20i,in%20classical%20mechanics%20when%20it)). Thus, it can be said that the state evolution of a quantum computer is always embedded and coupled with the universe's wave function: when the quantum computer interacts with its environment, its state becomes part of the universe's wave function; even if isolated, it remains part of the universe's overall quantum state, though it can be approximated as evolving independently for short periods. From the many-worlds/decoherence perspective, the universe's total wave function encompasses all possible states of the quantum computer and the observer, evolving uniformly and continuously ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)) ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=Resolving%20the%20paradox)).

# 2. Quantum Computer in the Classical World

**How does quantum computer affect the observation process in the classical world?**

The core interaction between a quantum computer and the classical world lies in the **measurement process**. In the classical world, obtaining results from a quantum computer requires measuring its quantum bits, converting quantum information into classical information. This process is essentially a quantum measurement, no different from observations in any quantum physics experiment. The distinction is that we have the ability to delay observation in quantum computing: during operation, the quantum computer is meticulously isolated to avoid environmental interference (equivalent to avoiding premature "observation"), thereby maintaining quantum coherence for computation. Only once the computation is complete do we measure the quantum bits using classical readout devices, collapsing the superposition into a definite classical result. This practice of delayed measurement highlights the impact of quantum observation on computation: **any premature environmental interaction introduces decoherence, converting quantum superposition into a classical mixed state and disrupting the computation** ([What Is Quantum Computing? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Decoherence%20is%20the%20process%20in,and%20interact%20with%20classical%20computers)). Thus, the existence of quantum computers in the classical world forces us to more clearly delineate the boundary between quantum and classical—preventing observation until necessary and precisely executing observation when reading results. **This deepens our understanding of observation**: it is not a mysterious instance in time but a process where the quantum system becomes entangled with a vast environment (measurement instruments, air, electrons, etc.). Quantum computing practice shows that as long as we strictly control environmental interactions (i.e., control when "observation" occurs), we can prolong quantum evolution; once environmental contact is allowed, observation inevitably occurs, and quantum behaviour immediately transitions to classical behaviour ([What Is Quantum Computing? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Decoherence%20is%20the%20process%20in,and%20interact%20with%20classical%20computers)). In summary, quantum computers remind us that **observation itself is a physical interaction process**: the classical world's influence on quantum systems is through observation, turning quantum information into classical information, consistent with traditional measurement theory, but quantum computers make this process more controllable and delayable.

**Does a Quantum Computer Collapse with Our World When Observed?**

From the perspective of any single observer, when you measure a quantum computer, its state becomes definite along with the observer's classical world—meaning the quantum computer's superposition appears to "collapse" into a definite result in our world. This can be understood as: **measurement entangles the quantum computer with the observer (and the measurement device), ultimately forming a joint definite state.** In the traditional Copenhagen interpretation, one would say the quantum computer's wave function collapses into an eigenstate at the moment of measurement, and the observer obtains the corresponding result. Alternatively, in the many-worlds view, the observer, device, and quantum computer form an entangled state, with each outcome corresponding to a branching world ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=not%20even%20a%20single%20particle,1%20and%20Frieda%20saw%201)). For example, the Wigner's friend thought experiment illustrates this concept of joint collapse: a friend in a lab measures a quantum bit, seeing only a definite 0 or 1—from the friend's perspective, the bit's wave function has collapsed. However, from Wigner's perspective outside the lab, the friend and the quantum bit are in a **superposition of both outcomes** (friend sees 0 and bit is 0, or friend sees 1 and bit is 1) ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=not%20even%20a%20single%20particle,1%20and%20Frieda%20saw%201)). Only when Wigner interacts with the friend (e.g., asking for the result) does the entire system present a single outcome to Wigner ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=saw%200%2C%20and%20a%20state,1%20and%20Frieda%20saw%201)). In other words, before external observation, the quantum computer and the nearest observer may remain in a joint quantum superposition; but once information spreads to the broader classical environment, all related systems (quantum computer, measurement device, observer) **collapse into a consistent classical reality** ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=saw%200%2C%20and%20a%20state,1%20and%20Frieda%20saw%201)) ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=Frieda%20says%20that%20the%20collapse,the%20collapse%20physically%20took%20place)). Therefore, when we observe a quantum computer in the classical world, from a macroscopic perspective, the quantum computer and our world "synchronise" to produce a definite result, equivalent to collapsing into a branch (in many-worlds terms) or entering a definite state (in collapse interpretation terms). This process is also called **"entangled collapse"**: measurement tightly correlates the observer's and the system's states, making it impossible to consider them separately. Thus, we achieve a consistent reality at the classical level. In summary, regardless of interpretation details, **observation links the quantum computer's and observer's states, resulting in a single outcome in the observer's world** ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=not%20even%20a%20single%20particle,1%20and%20Frieda%20saw%201)).

**Can This Collapse Be Observed Experimentally?**

Directly "seeing" wave function collapse is challenging because observing the collapse means you participate in the observation process and trigger the collapse. However, physicists have designed ingenious experiments to indirectly verify and explore collapse. For example, recent extended Wigner's Friend experiments provide relevant evidence: in a six-photon quantum experiment, researchers simulated two separated observers (akin to two Wigner's friends) measuring the same system, violating corresponding Bell inequalities (([[1902.05080] Experimental test of local observer-independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05080#:~:text=dramatically%20exposed%20in%20Eugene%20Wigner%27s,result%20implies%20that%20quantum%20theory))). The experiment found that different observers' results for the same event **cannot be reconciled within an observer-independent objective reality framework** ([[1902.05080] Experimental test of local observer-independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05080#:~:text=dramatically%20exposed%20in%20Eugene%20Wigner%27s,result%20implies%20that%20quantum%20theory)). In other words, if we insist on locality and free choice assumptions, **the experiment suggests quantum theory must be explained in an observer-dependent manner** ([[1902.05080] Experimental test of local observer-independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05080#:~:text=these%20realities%20can%20be%20reconciled,dependent%20way))—meaning an event that has collapsed for one observer may still be in superposition for another. This hints at the absence of a single "absolute collapse." If the wave function truly collapsed at an objective moment, different observers should not encounter such inconsistencies. Thus, such experiments support that "collapse" is not a physically absolute event across observers but is either relative or non-existent, with each observer seeing different outcomes ([[1902.05080] Experimental test of local observer-independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05080#:~:text=dramatically%20exposed%20in%20Eugene%20Wigner%27s,result%20implies%20that%20quantum%20theory)).

Additionally, **weak measurement and quantum** erasure techniques have allowed partial observation of collapse. For instance, in superconducting qubit experiments, researchers performed **partial measurements** (weak measurement), causing partial collapse, then reversed it through specific operations, effectively **undoing the collapse** ([Physics - Undoing a quantum measurement](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.1.34#:~:text=Quantum%20measurements%20are%20conventionally%20thought,continuous%20measurement%20can%20be%20restored)). As reported: traditional views hold that quantum measurement irreversibly collapses the wave function, **but experiments show partial collapse from weak continuous measurement can be reversed** ([Physics - Undoing a quantum measurement](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.1.34#:~:text=Quantum%20measurements%20are%20conventionally%20thought,continuous%20measurement%20can%20be%20restored)). In the experiment, scientists first weakly probed the quantum state (not fully collapsing it), applied an additional quantum operation, then performed a second measurement. If neither measurement yielded definitive results, the quantum state returned to its initial state—partial collapse was "reversed" ([Physics - Undoing a quantum measurement](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.1.34#:~:text=superconducting%20qubits%20show%20that%20the,continuous%20measurement%20can%20be%20restored)) ([Physics - Undoing a quantum measurement](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.1.34#:~:text=phase%20qubit%20potential%20during%20the,wave%20function%20has%20been%20undone)). This clearly shows **collapse is not an immutable, irreversible process**; at least for partial measurements, if observation information hasn't fully dissipated into the environment, we can restore the quantum state. This proves we can somewhat "observe" collapse and its reversal—because without partial collapse, there would be nothing to "restore." Thus, weak measurement experiments directly probe collapse.

Another classic experiment is **the delayed-choice quantum erasure experiment**. While it doesn't directly "capture" collapse, it demonstrates that observation information's influence on the quantum state can be manipulated, inferring collapse ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=This%20experiment%20involves%20an%20apparatus,so%20before%20or%20after%20its)) ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=apparatus%20between%20the%20photon%20emitter,3)). In the quantum erasure experiment, if we obtain path information (i.e., observe which slit), interference fringes disappear (equivalent to wave function collapse into a mixed state). Remarkably, we can **later** "erase" the path information, restoring interference ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=classic%20double,3))! As described: **photons marked with path information don't produce interference, but if "unmarked," they interfere again, restoring double-slit fringes** ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=classic%20double,3)). This shows that when path information exists in the environment (even in another entangled photon), the system behaves classically (no interference, as if collapse occurred); but if the information is erased, interference (quantum coherence) reappears. This supports the view that **collapse isn't irreversible destruction but more like quantum coherence leaking into the environment**; as long as this information isn't irreversibly lost, we can return the system to superposition. The delayed-choice quantum erasure experiment, through clever post-selection, indirectly "observes" collapse's impact ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=This%20experiment%20involves%20an%20apparatus,so%20before%20or%20after%20its)) ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=apparatus%20between%20the%20photon%20emitter,3)).

Moreover, physicists are expanding quantum phenomena's macroscopic boundaries, testing objective collapse theories through interference experiments. For example, interference experiments with massive objects or complex molecules test whether wave functions spontaneously collapse at macroscopic scales. So far, such experiments (including interference with large molecules of thousands of atoms and quantum state experiments with nanoscale mechanical oscillators) **have found no deviations from quantum mechanics predictions** ([Physics Experiments Spell Doom for Quantum ‘Collapse’ Theory | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/#:~:text=But%20now%20we%20may%20be,varieties%20of%20these%20collapse%20models)). High-sensitivity experiments have strictly limited parameters for so-called "objective collapse models," with simple collapse theories facing rejection ([Physics Experiments Spell Doom for Quantum ‘Collapse’ Theory | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/#:~:text=But%20now%20we%20may%20be,varieties%20of%20these%20collapse%20models)). As a authoritative review states: **recent precision experiments using particle physics detectors to test "wave function physical collapse" hypotheses found no predicted effects in the simplest collapse models** ([Physics Experiments Spell Doom for Quantum ‘Collapse’ Theory | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/#:~:text=But%20now%20we%20may%20be,varieties%20of%20these%20collapse%20models)). While we cannot entirely rule out any form of objective collapse in nature, results suggest that if it exists, it requires a more complex and subtle mechanism than previously thought; meanwhile, **quantum mechanics' predictions (without collapse) have withstood scrutiny at all scales** ([Physics Experiments Spell Doom for Quantum ‘Collapse’ Theory | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/#:~:text=physical%20process%20%E2%80%94%20an%20idea,varieties%20of%20these%20collapse%20models)). In summary, collapse as an observable phenomenon can be probed through cleverly designed experiments—either by indirectly capturing collapse through quantum coherence disappearance and restoration (e.g., weak measurement and quantum erasure), or by challenging absolute collapse's existence through conflicting observer results (Wigner's Friend experiments), or by advancing larger-scale quantum interference to detect additional collapse mechanisms. Current evidence supports the view that **wave function collapse is not a real dynamical process in fundamental equations but rather a phenomenon arising from quantum systems' entanglement with the environment from our perspective**.

# 3. New Interpretation of Measurement and Collapse

**Does the existing measurement theory support the above viewpoint?**

Yes, contemporary frameworks of quantum measurement largely support the view that "collapse is merely apparent," aligning with the analysis above. Firstly, **environmental decoherence theory** provides a collapse-free mechanism to explain the emergence of classical phenomena. According to decoherence theory, after a quantum system interacts with its environment, its initial pure state evolves into a larger pure state entangled with the environment. However, if we only consider the system itself, it appears to lose coherence and become a **statistical mixture** ([Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence#:~:text=system%2C%20i,in%20classical%20mechanics%20when%20it)). This precisely explains the collapse observed during measurement: the measuring apparatus (environment) acquires information about the system, causing the system's interference terms to vanish. Yet, in the overall universal wave function (including the apparatus), no non-unitary process is introduced—the total wave function remains pure, albeit branching into multiple outcomes ([Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence#:~:text=system%2C%20i,in%20classical%20mechanics%20when%20it)). Thus, decoherence theory posits that measurement causes **"apparent collapse"**: to the observer, the system seems to collapse into a definite state, but this is merely because its coherence has leaked into the environment, while the overall quantum superposition persists on a larger scale ([Quantum decoherence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence#:~:text=system%2C%20i,in%20classical%20mechanics%20when%20it)). This theory aligns perfectly with our earlier discussion of the "universe as a whole quantum computation"—no external collapse assumption is needed to explain why we observe only one outcome. Secondly, the aforementioned **quantum erasure experiments** strongly support the decoherence picture: when measurement allows information to reside in the environment (even in entangled photons), interference disappears (equivalent to classical outcomes); but if the environment is prevented from retaining this information (by erasing path information), interference can be restored ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=classic%20double,3)) ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=apparatus%20between%20the%20photon%20emitter,3)). This demonstrates that **the key to measurement's impact lies in whether information is retained in the environment**, consistent with decoherence theory's explanation of collapse (i.e., collapse is essentially irreversible information dissipation).

**The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)** directly embraces this view: it assumes the wave function never collapses, and during measurement, the universe (including the observer) splits into branches corresponding to each outcome, with each observer experiencing only one result ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,the%20formulation%20and%20named%20it)) ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)). MWI is closely related to decoherence—modern versions of MWI treat decoherence as the physical process generating effective "branches" ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=In%20modern%20versions%20of%20many,2)). On one hand, MWI provides an intuitive picture: **"all possible outcomes are realised in different 'worlds'"** ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,the%20formulation%20and%20named%20it)), which aligns with our earlier discussion that quantum computers continue evolving in the universe without truly stopping. On the other hand, it avoids artificially dividing the quantum/classical boundary or introducing special collapse rules, maintaining quantum theory's consistency across all scales ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=and%20so%20describes%20the%20whole,and%20there%20is%20no%20collapse)). In MWI, measurement is just an ordinary quantum interaction: **"the observer and the observed become correlated (entangled), without invoking collapse"** ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,quantum%20and%20a%20classical%20domain)). Each observer is also governed by quantum mechanics, so there is no mysterious "classical measurement" process: what we call collapse is simply the observer's consciousness landing on a particular branch ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)). This fully supports our discussion of quantum continuity: the emergence of classical outcomes does not imply quantum evolution halts; rather, we become part of a specific branch. In fact, MWI asserts that **"there is no fundamental quantum/classical divide: everything is quantum, and there is no collapse"** ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)).

**Quantum erasure** and **delayed-choice** experiments are also part of measurement theory, providing not only support for decoherence/MWI but also concrete experimental evidence. As mentioned earlier, quantum erasure demonstrates that acquiring or erasing measurement information directly affects whether interference is observed, contradicting the Copenhagen interpretation's notion of "measurement causing irreversible collapse" but aligning with decoherence and MWI (since information is not truly lost, quantum phenomena can be restored) ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=classic%20double,3)) ([Quantum eraser experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment#:~:text=apparatus%20between%20the%20photon%20emitter,3)). Extensions like quantum Darwinism are also noteworthy: it emphasises that the environment **redundantly records** system information, and only states widely recorded (disseminated) by the environment become the "objective reality" we collectively observe ([
The Role of Decoherence in Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#:~:text=stronger%20sense%2C%20because%20information%20about,we%20observe%20%E2%80%93)). This explains why different observers typically see the same measurement results: because the environment has copied the information of one outcome onto countless particles, granting it objectivity ([
The Role of Decoherence in Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#:~:text=stronger%20sense%2C%20because%20information%20about,we%20observe%20%E2%80%93)). If an outcome leaves no trace in the environment (e.g., in a strictly isolated Wigner's friend scenario), there is no public objective collapse, potentially leading to conflicting "facts" among observers. Quantum Darwinism complements MWI/decoherence: it does not require the wave function to truly collapse but only needs the environment to selectively amplify certain components, making us effectively observe only those components. This further supports the idea that "collapse" is an **emergent phenomenon** (caused by environmental selection), and existing measurement frameworks tend to favour this explanation over introducing new collapse dynamics.

**How Does the Integration of Classical and Quantum Computers Affect Our Understanding of Quantum Measurement?**

The integration of classical and quantum computers exemplifies the continuity of the quantum-classical boundary. Classical computers are fundamentally composed of quantum components (e.g., atoms, electrons), but their quantum coherence has long vanished due to environmental interactions, stabilising into classical binary states (0 or 1). When we use classical computers to control or read quantum computers, we are effectively allowing **a large number of entangled quantum degrees of freedom (the classical apparatus) to interact with quantum bits**, thereby "measuring" the quantum state. No physical laws are broken here: the classical computer is simply a large quantum system whose state space has been compressed into the familiar classical states due to decoherence. Thus, the integration of classical and quantum systems provides a compelling example: **quantum measurement can be viewed as the interaction between two quantum systems (the measuring apparatus and the measured object), where one system is sufficiently complex and entangled with the environment to exhibit classical determinism macroscopically**. MWI even explicitly states that we can model measurement by treating the observer (or classical apparatus) as an ordinary quantum system ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=The%20many,quantum%20and%20a%20classical%20domain)). From this unified perspective, there is no need to artificially separate quantum and classical domains: classical computers are merely phenomenological products emerging under certain limits of quantum mechanics. Once we accept this, our understanding of quantum measurement advances: measurement is no longer a fundamental post hoc assumption (as in the Copenhagen interpretation) but a **natural outcome of quantum evolution**. The process of a classical computer reading a quantum bit is equivalent to countless environmental particles reading the quantum state—except here, the "environment" is a device we design to be controllable and reliably record results. Therefore, the classical-quantum integration demonstrates that **quantum mechanics universally applies to macroscopic devices and observers**, and the measurement problem can be consistently addressed within quantum theory ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=Resolving%20the%20paradox)) ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=and%20so%20describes%20the%20whole,and%20there%20is%20no%20collapse)). The modern understanding of quantum measurement is this: when considering a sufficiently large closed system (including experimental apparatus and observers), the entire system still follows Schrödinger dynamics, with no mysterious collapse; what we call collapse is merely the perception caused by irreversible loss of coherence in subsystems. The integration of classical and quantum computing devices turns this abstract insight into practical laboratory operations: we must keep the quantum part coherent and then obtain results through interaction with the classical part. In this process, quantum information becomes classical information, and quantum correlations become classical correlations—this is quantum measurement. In summary, the integration of classical and quantum systems **demystifies measurement**, revealing that classical measurement processes are simply manifestations of quantum laws on a larger scale.

**Can experiments be designed to verify whether a quantum computer "collapses"?**

As mentioned earlier, Wigner's Friend-type experiments are one direction. While current proof-of-concept validations exist in photon systems ([[1902.05080] Experimental test of local observer-independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05080#:~:text=dramatically%20exposed%20in%20Eugene%20Wigner%27s,result%20implies%20that%20quantum%20theory)), future possibilities include larger-scale **"quantum friend"** experiments: for instance, having a small quantum computer (or AI) act as Wigner's friend, measuring another quantum system in a closed environment, and then having an external observer attempt to intervene or observe whether the joint system still exhibits quantum coherence. As quantum technology advances, we might enable a quantum device to record measurement results while remaining isolated from the external environment, then use quantum interference to check whether the combined state of the device and the measured system remains coherent. If we can perform interference measurements on the entire "box" without disturbing the observer inside (e.g., allowing the quantum computer in the box to remain in a superposition of two outcomes and having an external interferometer recombine these branches), we could directly test whether collapse occurs. In principle, if MWI/decoherence is correct, the external observer should see interference fringes, proving the superposition of the quantum computer's two outcomes still exists; conversely, if the wave function objectively collapses inside the box, the external observer would see no interference, only mixed probabilistic outcomes. While fully **isolated macroscopic observer** interference experiments remain challenging, such experimental concepts are being seriously discussed. In fact, theoretical and preliminary experimental efforts are already underway, such as using superconducting quantum circuits to simulate "quantum measurers" and measured systems. As technology matures, we could extend the "quantum Schrödinger's cat" to more complex observers. At that point, we could directly test whether a quantum computer running and measuring another quantum system remains in a quantum superposition. Such experiments would undoubtedly verify whether quantum computers themselves undergo collapse or merely entangle with the environment.

Simultaneously, we can verify collapse effects by **introducing controlled observations during quantum computation**. For example, in certain algorithms, we can insert a selective measurement midway, then continue the algorithm to see how the results change. This is equivalent to artificially introducing collapse and comparing it with collapse-free evolution. If the quantum computer truly evolves according to quantum mechanics (without collapse), the midway measurement (collapse) would disrupt the interference pattern, significantly reducing the final success rate; without measurement, interference is preserved, and the algorithm's success rate remains high. Such comparisons are already evident in many quantum algorithms and experiments: **any unnecessary measurement disrupts quantum computation**, reflecting the real impact of collapse (observation) on quantum evolution. Through meticulous experimental design, we can even **"peek" at the quantum state while preserving coherence** (using weak measurement), allowing us to map the "gradual" process of collapse. For instance, gradually increasing measurement strength and observing how interference disappears could yield a detailed curve of the collapse process. This is experimentally feasible, as weak measurement techniques are mature enough to continuously monitor a quantum bit's state without overly disturbing it, recording the trajectory of coherence decay. Such experiments could **quantitatively characterise the conditions and speed of collapse**, verify theoretical predictions like decoherence times, and compare them with collapse models.

Finally, it is worth emphasising that **current experiments tend to support the completeness of quantum mechanics, with no need to introduce objective collapse** ([Physics Experiments Spell Doom for Quantum ‘Collapse’ Theory | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/#:~:text=But%20now%20we%20may%20be,varieties%20of%20these%20collapse%20models)). If future, more sensitive experiments (e.g., interference at larger mass scales or superposition of more complex observers) continue to support this, we will have stronger reasons to believe: the universe indeed operates like a continuously running quantum computer, with every part (including us and our quantum computers) evolving under unified quantum laws. Measurement is merely the process of information flow between subsystems within this "universal quantum computer," not a switch that halts computation. In summary, by combining the latest experiments and theories, we are gradually approaching the understanding that **wave function collapse is more like an effective phenomenon, a declaration of local systems losing coherence, rather than the cessation of fundamental physical processes** ([Wigner's friend with Qiskit | IBM Quantum Computing Blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/wigners-friend-qiskit#:~:text=One%20approach%20to%20resolving%20the,are%20fully%20reversible%2C%20including%20measurements)) ([Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#:~:text=the%20Copenhagen%20interpretation%20%2C%20in,1%20%5D%20Sometimes%20dubbed)). As experimental technology advances, we will be able to verify this more deeply, refining our understanding of quantum measurement and the nature of reality.

They show that our understanding of the role of quantum computers in the universe, the effects of measurement-induced collapse, and the quantum-classical boundary is becoming increasingly clear and empirically grounded.
