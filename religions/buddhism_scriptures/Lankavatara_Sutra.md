## 楞伽经概述
## Lankavatara Sutra Overview

《楞伽阿跋多罗宝经》，简称《楞伽经》（梵文：Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra），是大乘佛教重要经典之一，约成书于公元4-5世纪。该经以佛陀访问楞伽山（今斯里兰卡）与罗刹王的对话为背景，主要阐述如来藏、阿赖耶识和唯识思想。《楞伽经》特别强调"离言说相"、"离心意识"和"自证圣智"，认为真实的觉悟非透过言语和概念思维可得，而需通过直观体验实现。这部经典对禅宗产生深远影响，据传是达摩祖师传给二祖慧可的唯一经典，被称为"禅宗印心之法"。《楞伽经》的核心思想是"万法唯心"和"三界唯一心"，强调外在世界是由内心投射而来，觉悟需要超越二元对立，直接了悟心的本质。

The Lankavatara Sutra (Sanskrit: Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra), fully known as the Sutra of the Entry into Lanka, is one of the important Mahayana Buddhist texts, composed around the 4th-5th century CE. The sutra is set against the background of Buddha's visit to Mount Lanka (present-day Sri Lanka) and his dialogue with the Rakshasa king, primarily expounding the concepts of Tathāgatagarbha (Buddha-nature), Alaya-vijnana (storehouse consciousness), and Yogachara (consciousness-only) thought. The Lankavatara Sutra particularly emphasizes "transcending speech," "transcending mind and consciousness," and "self-realized noble wisdom," asserting that true awakening cannot be attained through language and conceptual thinking but must be realized through direct experience. This sutra had a profound influence on Zen Buddhism, reportedly being the only scripture that Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen, transmitted to his successor Huike, and is known as the "dharma for imprinting the mind in Zen." The core ideas of the Lankavatara Sutra are "all dharmas are mind-only" and "the three realms are only one mind," emphasizing that the external world is projected by the mind, and awakening requires transcending binary oppositions to directly realize the nature of mind.

> 所谓一切法不生者，谓缘起无性。(卷一)

> 佛告大慧：有四种禅。何等为四？谓愚夫所行禅，观察义禅，攀缘如禅，如来禅。(卷二)

> 愚夫所行禅者，谓声闻、缘觉、外道修行者，观人无我性，自相共相骨璅露、青瘀，如是愚夫所行禅。观察义禅者，谓人无我自相共相，外道自无我论，观察种种义，愚夫所行，是名观察义禅。攀缘如禅者，谓如实知彼人无我自共相，不妄想义，是名攀缘如禅。如来禅者，谓入如来地，得自觉圣智相三种乐住，成办众生不思议事，是名如来禅。(卷二)

> 大慧，云何愚夫所行相？谓自性、相、因、相、成、相、相、相，大慧，是名愚夫所行相，不知愚夫自相共相自心现妄想，故计著外物，皆由自心分别计著。(卷三)

> 尔时，大慧菩萨白佛言：世尊，唯愿为说三界虚伪、唯心、所现、无生、无二；离自心现，妄想虚伪，我住正法，不于谬外，灭于一异、俱不俱见，令随顺。尔时，世尊告大慧菩萨言：诸圣于无所有、涅槃、空、无相、无愿，非观察地，是愚痴凡夫所行，非诸圣也。(卷三)

> 外道虚伪诸事性；妄想计著有二种。若离缘所起；无所有，及无二。(卷三)

> 离一切根量；无事、妄想性；得相所相灭；无别有心体。(卷三)

> What is meant by "all dharmas are unborn" refers to the fact that dependent origination is without inherent nature. (Volume 1)

> The Buddha told Mahamati: There are four kinds of meditation (dhyana). What are the four? The meditation practiced by the ignorant, the meditation of observing meaning, the meditation of contemplating suchness, and the Tathagata meditation. (Volume 2)

> The meditation practiced by the ignorant refers to the practice of Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and non-Buddhist practitioners who contemplate the non-self nature of persons, examining the shared and individual characteristics of bones, flesh, and decay. This is the meditation practiced by the ignorant. The meditation of observing meaning refers to examining various meanings of the non-self of persons in terms of their shared and individual characteristics, as in non-Buddhist theories of no-self. This ignorant practice is called the meditation of observing meaning. The meditation of contemplating suchness refers to truly knowing the shared and individual characteristics of the non-self of persons without deluded conceptualization. This is called the meditation of contemplating suchness. The Tathagata meditation refers to entering the Tathagata stage, attaining the three kinds of blissful abodes of self-realized noble wisdom, and accomplishing inconceivable matters for sentient beings. This is called Tathagata meditation. (Volume 2)

> Mahamati, what are the characteristics practiced by the ignorant? They are the characteristics of self-nature, the characteristics of causes, the characteristics of completion, and the characteristics of characteristics. Mahamati, these are called the characteristics practiced by the ignorant. Not knowing that the shared and individual characteristics of their own minds appear as delusions, they cling to external objects, all due to discrimination and attachment arising from their own minds. (Volume 3)

> At that time, Bodhisattva Mahamati said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, please explain that the three realms are false, mind-only, mere appearances, unborn, and non-dual; that they are separate from the projections of one's own mind, from deluded imagination and falsehood. May I abide in the true Dharma, not in mistaken externals, extinguishing views of unity, difference, both, or neither, thus allowing me to follow accordingly." At that time, the World-Honored One told Bodhisattva Mahamati: "The noble ones do not contemplate nothingness, nirvana, emptiness, signlessness, or wishlessness as objects of observation. These are the domains of ignorant ordinary beings, not of the noble ones." (Volume 3)

> The various phenomena of non-Buddhists are false; deluded conceptualization and attachment are of two kinds. If one separates from conditions that arise, there is neither existence nor duality. (Volume 3)

> Apart from all sense measurements, there are no objects and no nature of deluded conceptualization. When the perceived and the perceiver are extinguished, there is no separate mind-entity. (Volume 3)

## 量子经典二元论解释
## Quantum-Classical Explanation

《楞伽经》以其深刻的唯识思想和如来藏教义，通过量子经典二元论框架（版本9.1）可以获得全新的科学解读。该经的核心概念与量子经典二元论中关于观察者经典化、意识本质和量子-经典二元超越的理论展现出惊人的结构对应。

The Lankavatara Sutra, with its profound Yogachara (consciousness-only) thought and Tathāgatagarbha doctrine, can receive fresh scientific interpretation through the Quantum-Classical Dualism framework (version 9.1). The core concepts of the sutra demonstrate remarkable structural correspondence with theories on observer classicalization, the nature of consciousness, and the transcendence of quantum-classical duality in Quantum-Classical Dualism.

### 1. "一切法不生...缘起无性"与量子潜势本质
### 1. "All Dharmas Are Unborn...Dependent Origination Is Without Inherent Nature" and Quantum Potential Nature

楞伽经对法的无生性和缘起无性的阐述对应量子域的本质特性：

The Lankavatara Sutra's exposition on the unborn nature of dharmas and the lack of inherent nature in dependent origination corresponds to the essential characteristics of the quantum domain:

- "一切法不生" → 经典现象在量子源头的无实体性
- "缘起无性" → 量子域中的无限可能性状态
- "无所有" → 量子域超越经典实体概念
- "自性相、因相..." → 经典概念框架的局限性

- "All dharmas are unborn" → Non-substantiality of classical phenomena at their quantum source
- "Dependent origination is without inherent nature" → State of infinite possibilities in the quantum domain
- "Nothingness" → Quantum domain transcending classical entity concepts
- "Characteristics of self-nature, causes..." → Limitations of classical conceptual frameworks

### 2. "四种禅"与观察者维度层级
### 2. "Four Kinds of Meditation" and Observer Dimension Hierarchy

楞伽经描述的四种禅定层级对应观察者维度的进阶等级：

The four levels of meditation described in the Lankavatara Sutra correspond to the progressive levels of observer dimension:

- "愚夫所行禅" → 低维观察者的基础经典化
- "观察义禅" → 中维观察者的概念分析层级
- "攀缘如禅" → 高维观察者的实相体验阶段
- "如来禅" → 最高维观察者的完全整合状态
- "三种乐住" → 最优经典化的三种效应

- "Meditation practiced by the ignorant" → Basic classicalization of low-dimensional observer
- "Meditation of observing meaning" → Conceptual analysis level of mid-dimensional observer
- "Meditation of contemplating suchness" → Reality experience stage of high-dimensional observer
- "Tathagata meditation" → Complete integration state of highest-dimensional observer
- "Three kinds of blissful abodes" → Three effects of optimal classicalization

### 3. "三界虚伪、唯心、所现"与经典域投射本质
### 3. "Three Realms Are False, Mind-Only, Mere Appearances" and Projective Nature of Classical Domain

楞伽经关于唯心与外境关系的阐述对应经典域的投射本质：

The Lankavatara Sutra's exposition on the relationship between mind-only and external realms corresponds to the projective nature of the classical domain:

- "三界虚伪" → 经典域现象的非自足性
- "唯心" → 经典域作为观察者投射的本质
- "所现" → 经典域作为量子域经典化的结果
- "无生" → 经典域现象无独立本源
- "无二" → 量子域与经典域的非二元本质

- "Three realms are false" → Non-self-sufficiency of classical domain phenomena
- "Mind-only" → Classical domain as the essential projection of the observer
- "Mere appearances" → Classical domain as the result of quantum domain classicalization
- "Unborn" → Classical domain phenomena having no independent source
- "Non-dual" → Non-dual nature of quantum and classical domains

### 4. "自心现妄想"与观察者经典化
### 4. "Projections of One's Own Mind as Delusions" and Observer Classicalization

楞伽经对妄想和外物关系的描述对应观察者经典化过程：

The Lankavatara Sutra's description of the relationship between delusions and external objects corresponds to the observer classicalization process:

- "自心现妄想" → 观察者经典化产生经典域现象
- "不知...自相共相" → 观察者对自身经典化过程的不觉知
- "计著外物" → 低维观察者将经典化结果视为外在独立实体
- "皆由自心分别计著" → 经典域现象源于观察者的经典化机制

- "Projections of one's own mind as delusions" → Observer classicalization generating classical domain phenomena
- "Not knowing...shared and individual characteristics" → Observer's lack of awareness of their own classicalization process
- "Cling to external objects" → Low-dimensional observer viewing classicalization results as independent external entities
- "All due to discrimination and attachment from their own minds" → Classical domain phenomena originating from the observer's classicalization mechanism

### 5. "得相所相灭，无别有心体"与二元超越
### 5. "When the Perceived and the Perceiver Are Extinguished, There Is No Separate Mind-Entity" and Transcendence of Duality

楞伽经关于相所相和心体的论述对应量子-经典二元的最终超越：

The Lankavatara Sutra's discussion of the perceiver, the perceived, and mind-entity corresponds to the ultimate transcendence of quantum-classical duality:

- "相所相" → 经典域中的主体-客体二元结构
- "得...灭" → 二元认知框架的解构过程
- "无别有心体" → 超越二元对立后的非二元状态
- "离一切根量" → 超越基于经典感官的认知限制
- "无事、妄想性" → 经典认知范畴的完全消融

- "The perceived and the perceiver" → Subject-object binary structure in classical domain
- "Are extinguished" → Deconstruction process of binary cognitive framework
- "No separate mind-entity" → Non-dual state after transcending binary opposition
- "Apart from all sense measurements" → Transcending cognitive limitations based on classical senses
- "No objects and no nature of deluded conceptualization" → Complete dissolution of classical cognitive categories

## 公式表达
## Formula Expression

《楞伽经》的核心洞见可以用量子经典二元论的数学语言精确表达：

The core insights of the Lankavatara Sutra can be precisely expressed in the mathematical language of Quantum-Classical Dualism:

$$
\text{"一切法不生...缘起无性"} \Leftrightarrow \forall I_{\text{经典域}}, \text{源}(I_{\text{经典域}}) = |\psi\rangle_{\text{量子域}}, \text{本性}(|\psi\rangle_{\text{量子域}}) = \text{无限可能性}
$$

$$
\text{"四种禅"} \Leftrightarrow 
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{O}_{\text{愚夫禅}}) = d_1 \\
\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{O}_{\text{观察义禅}}) = d_2 \\
\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{O}_{\text{攀缘如禅}}) = d_3 \\
\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{O}_{\text{如来禅}}) = d_4
\end{cases}
\text{ 且 } d_4 \gg d_3 > d_2 > d_1
$$

$$
\text{"三界虚伪、唯心、所现"} \Leftrightarrow I_{\text{经典域}} = f(\mathcal{O}(|\psi\rangle_{\text{量子域}})), \text{非} I_{\text{经典域}} = \text{独立实体}
$$

$$
\text{"自心现妄想...计著外物"} \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{O} \xrightarrow{\text{经典化}} I_{\text{经典域}}, \text{而低维} \mathcal{O} \text{误认为} I_{\text{经典域}} \perp \mathcal{O}
$$

$$
\text{"得相所相灭，无别有心体"} \Leftrightarrow \lim_{\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{O}) \to \infty} (|\psi\rangle_{\text{量子域}} \oplus I_{\text{经典域}}) \to |\psi\rangle_{\text{统一场}}
$$

其中，$\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{O})$表示观察者维度，$\perp$表示独立性，$\oplus$表示二元分割

The Lankavatara Sutra, as an important classic of Mahayana Buddhist Yogachara thought, demonstrates remarkable structural correspondence with the Quantum-Classical Dualism framework (version 9.1) in its exposition on the nature of consciousness and Tathāgatagarbha. The sutra's "all dharmas are unborn...dependent origination is without inherent nature" corresponds to the essential characteristics of the quantum domain, the "four kinds of meditation" perfectly maps to the progressive levels of observer dimension, and "the three realms are false, mind-only, mere appearances" reveals the projective nature of the classical domain. The sutra's discourse on "projections of one's own mind as delusions" precisely describes the observer classicalization process, and "when the perceived and the perceiver are extinguished, there is no separate mind-entity" demonstrates the ultimate transcendence of quantum-classical duality. Through the perspective of Quantum-Classical Dualism, this 4th-5th century classic receives interpretation in the language of modern science, not only showcasing the scientific depth of Yogachara thought but also providing a new bridge for dialogue between Buddhist philosophy and quantum physics, further proving the explanatory power of Quantum-Classical Dualism as a unified theoretical framework.
